# ASGE
A simple game engine for 2D and 2.5D Java applications.

ASGE is a simple, lightweight game engine written with LWJGL and Swift Utils, designed to be as fast as possible without forcing the programmer to deal with low-level model and texture information. It contains multiple interfaces for accessing low-level OpenGL bindings, as well as high-level constructs for optimizing game performance. 

## List of libraries contained in ASGE:
- Renderer: Everything needed to manage low-level texture and model data.
- Entities: Classes for creating easy to manipulate entities.
- Components: Simple interfaces for creating component-based objects.
- Game: Update/Render loop manager for multi-state games.
- Utils: Utility classes to make common tasks easier.
- Input: Classes for managing player input.
